What Are Channels?

a Channel is a . NET data structure or collection where we can store data from producer and at the same time consumer can retrieve it without needing to any additional synchronization from our side.

Producer/Consumer describes the act of a producer publishing a message, and there being one or more consumers who can act on that message, but each message is only read once. It is not duplicated out to each subscriber.
